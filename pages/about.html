            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>How did you get in to the sport ?</h3>
            <p>My love for contact sport and the desire to become a champion. I joined MMA
                hoping to find my place among fighters and to learn, however it didn't fill my
                cup and started looking for other opportunities that fits my fighting style. With
                my family's motivation and support I've finally found my flighting foundation.</p>
                <br>
            <h3>What is your favourite strike to use in a fight ?</h3>
                <p>My favourite strike is the jab. It's deceiving and allows me to simultaneously
                    use offence and defence measures and create openings to the head and
                    body.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Who is your biggest inspiration
                        ?
                        </h3>
                        <p>Mike Tyson is definitely my inspiration because of how determined he was to
                            be the best and the type of fighter he is.
                            He is an roll model to a lot of young boxers and he inspired me to become a
                            boxer.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>What team are you training with?</h3>
                            <p>The best club in the southern part of Johannesburg, South-hills Boxing Club
                                and with the best team that motivates each other, trained by our coach Lyle.
                                It's the best place to be and my second home.
                                What does it mean for you to be a boxer?
                                It means everything to me, there is nothing i'd rather be than a professional
                                boxer. It's like reading my Bible, it gives me motivation and stength and a clear
                                mind.
                                I never walk out of a training session regretting what I've leaned.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>What seperates you from other boxers in your division?</h3>
                                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quae quia labore ab.
                                    Sapiente veritatis beatae delectus quo omnis a voluptates. Fuga possimus
                                    sequi ex suscipit doloribus consequatur, corporis, accusamus accusantium.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>If you could have a dream fight, who would it be?</h3>
                                    <p>Kenelo Aver. He is a formidable fighter and has good techniques and is a well
                                        known boxer. I want to fight him to truly test my skills.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h3>What would you like to be remembered for at the end of your career?</h3>
                                        <p>To be known as the boxer who went from nothing to something in the shortest
                                            period of time. I want to make history that will last for centuries and hopefully
                                            become a inspiration to others and teaching self defence.</p>
